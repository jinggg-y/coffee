# Individual Project - Online learning platform 

## Coffee sensation

Coffee Sensation is an online learning system for coffee lovers that brings the community to share 
knowledge of coffee from different aspects, including coffee origins, coffee beans processing, 
brewing techniques, and latte art showcasing. Coffee Sensation delivers engaging experiences for 
both educators and learners. Educators can start a course and upload learning content, and students 
can enrol in a course and view and download learning materials. Coffee Sensation provides upskilling 
opportunities for coffee enthusiasts, from beginners to experts.

## MVC design

This project is to deliver an MVP for Coffee Sensation. The web app will be based on the Model, View, Controller (MVC) design, 
where CodeIgniter is selected as the MVC template.

- Model: A relational database to store all the data, including user information and course 
materials. The database will be managed by MySQL.
- View: The website front end will be built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where Bootstrap will 
be utilised for a modern and consistent UI design.
- Controller: Users will be able to submit data input, upload and download files and interact 
with the system via the functions that have been created in the CodeIgniter controller. 
As the target users are coffee educators and learners from all levels, the web app will have the 
feature of role management and user access control. Besides that, to satisfy usersâ€™ learning 
experience, Coffee Sensation has the feature of file upload and download, certificate generation, 
and content search
